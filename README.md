Agriculture Analytics Dashboard

This project provides a dashboard for agricultural analytics based on data from India. It includes functionalities to display crops with maximum and minimum production for each year between 1950 and 2020, as well as average yield and cultivation area for crops over the same period.


Getting Started

Prerequisites  
Node.js (version >= 12.0.0)  
npm or yarn  
Installation  
Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:prince8076/agriculture-analytics.git  

cd agriculture-analytics-dashboard

Install dependencies:yarn install or npm install


Available Scripts  

In the project directory,
you can run: npm start 

Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the running tests section for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the deployment section for more information.

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


Features
Crops with Maximum and Minimum Production: Displays which crops had the highest and lowest production in each year from 1950 to 2020.

Average Yield and Cultivation Area: Shows the average yield and cultivation area of crops over the specified period.

Styling: Uses Mantine v7 for consistent styling and components.
